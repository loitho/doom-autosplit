Hi

Here is a livesplit file for doom

It should be working with the latest version of Doom from steam only if you removed the 
- gameresources.patch 
- gameresources.patch.verify
Files from your DOOM/base/ folder.

Removing those two files will make you able to do one specific jump in the second level (ressource operations)



actual Features :

Auto start : Should be working  (90 % sure)

Removing loading time : Works (100% sure) 

Split at each level change : Should be working (90% sure)  /!\ it splits only at the end of the loading screen you get when finishing a level. Not when you push a button.




New features comming soon !
